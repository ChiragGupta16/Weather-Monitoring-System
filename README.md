# Weather-Monitoring-System
In this project, I have made a waether monitoring system which records temperature and Humidity.<br>
Here I have used ESP32 and DHT11 Sensor to collect data.<br>
The data is then sent to ThingSpeak Cloud.<br>
There it has been visualised using MATLAB.

<h5>Libraries Used :</h4>
<p>WiFi.h<br> DHTesp.h<br> ThingSpeak.h</p>
